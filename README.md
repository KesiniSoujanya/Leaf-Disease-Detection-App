The "Leaf Disease Detection Flask App" aims to develop a user-friendly web application for detecting plant leaf diseases using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on creating a robust system capable of accurately identifying various types of diseases aBecting plant leaves. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the app will empower users, including farmers and gardeners, to quickly diagnose plant health issues, thereby facilitating timely interventions to prevent crop losses and maintain plant vitality.
